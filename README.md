# klein-gordon-fdm
 
C++ program which solves the Klein-Gordon equation using a
finite-difference method to simulate the evolution of a scalar field on a spatial grid with periodic boundary conditions in
order to show how certain scalar fields can obey relativistic wave dynamics and dispersion laws.
